chunk-P6UG2CKT.js?v=00831187:1319 styled-components: it looks like an unknown prop "attribute" is being sent through to the DOM, which will likely trigger a React console error. If you would like automatic filtering of unknown props, you can opt-into that behavior via `<StyleSheetManager shouldForwardProp={...}>` (connect an API like `@emotion/is-prop-valid`) or consider using transient props (`$` prefix for automatic filtering.)

chunk-P6UG2CKT.js?v=00831187:1319 styled-components: it looks like an unknown prop "justifyContent" is being sent through to the DOM, which will likely trigger a React console error. If you would like automatic filtering of unknown props, you can opt-into that behavior via `<StyleSheetManager shouldForwardProp={...}>` (connect an API like `@emotion/is-prop-valid`) or consider using transient props (`$` prefix for automatic filtering.)

chunk-47RN6QNY.js?v=00831187:521 Warning: React does not recognize the `justifyContent` prop on a DOM element. If you intentionally want it to appear in the DOM as a custom attribute, spell it as lowercase `justifycontent` instead. If you accidentally passed it from a parent component, remove it from the DOM element.

chunk-P6UG2CKT.js?v=00831187:1346 Over 200 classes were generated for component styled.div with the id of "sc-beySbL".
Consider using the attrs method, together with a style object for frequently changed styles.
Example:
  const Component = styled.div.attrs(props => ({
    style: {
      background: props.background,
    },
  }))`width: 100%;`

  <Component />

chunk-P6UG2CKT.js?v=00831187:1319 styled-components: it looks like an unknown prop "error" is being sent through to the DOM, which will likely trigger a React console error. If you would like automatic filtering of unknown props, you can opt-into that behavior via `<StyleSheetManager shouldForwardProp={...}>` (connect an API like `@emotion/is-prop-valid`) or consider using transient props (`$` prefix for automatic filtering.)
